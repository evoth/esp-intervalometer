TODO

- Reduce global variables
- COMMENTS!
- Better error handling (count number, notify user, etc.)
- Less global CSS, move to components
- Do theme in a more "correct" way with conditional classes
- Make entire section heading clickable
- Ability to set duration (either time or number of shots)
- Ability to add delay (time or amount of time)
- Bulb exposure mode
- Quantize timing using mod, but do it smartly so we don't try to spam it after being stuck/paused
