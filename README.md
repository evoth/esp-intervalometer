TODO

- Reduce global variables
- Better error handling (count number, notify user, etc.)
- Ability to set duration (either time or number of shots)
- Ability to add delay (time or amount of time)
- Quantize timing using mod, but do it smartly so we don't try to spam it after being stuck/paused
- Ability to connect multiple cameras?
- Fix bug where intervalSec is overridden when disabling/enabling bulb mode
